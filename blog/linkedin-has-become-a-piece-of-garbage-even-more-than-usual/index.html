It's always nice to see what people have been up to. Second, while I haven't found a job thru it, many recruiters have reached out so its worth keeping a presence there.</p><p>So far, LinkedIn has been sort of usable.

I typed in a quick congrats and sent it.</p><p>Then I saw the date on the message: It was 3 months old. They had found a job 3 months ago, it had turned up on my feed just then.</p><p>I thought it was a coincidence but then it happened again. This time, the 2-month-old post was shown to me <strong>5 times</strong>. I was like, yeah, I get it. Is nothing else happening to the people in my feed? I know there is, because if I go on their profiles I can see them posting. It's just not turning up on my home page.</p><h3 id="but-wait-it-gets-worse">But wait!

I get it, companies need to make money. I'm okay with some ads.</p><p>What I'm not okay with is 8-10 ads for 1 post from my feed. I had so many ads (and I counted– 10:1 was a standard ratio of ads:post), that I couldn't see the posts from the people I had connected to.</p><p>And it wasn't normal ads– Ads on LinkedIn show up as "Promoted". These are okay– I've never clicked on one, but at least some are useful.</p><p>But LinkedIn has started showing these "Suggested" posts by random weirdos on the internet. Most of them are garbage– they are from the sort of SEO spammy sites we see on Google and the reason I avoid using Google.</p><p>One post was like: <em>Top 7 API methods in Java</em></p><p>and I was like, I've never even used Java. If Java was crossing the road and met my gaze, I would be like, <em>Who are you, Bro?</em></p><p>The posts are the classic spammy ones– you can tell by the titles and the slick images:</p><p><strong><em>The 7 best ways to test your web app (Number 3 will shock you!)</em></strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-aAVy2CQgzAWeTOGIcVvWEcsb?se=2024-01-29T14%3A47%3A35Z&amp;sp=r&amp;sv=2021-08-06&amp;sr=b&amp;rscc=max-age%3D31536000%2C%20immutable&amp;rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3D5c11a09c-5598-4e6d-96d6-e4829f2e6ca6.webp&amp;sig=0wN777p2ak8%2BHjFea4kAqiziciHuL6PvFnyf0mld3rw%3D" class="kg-image" alt="Generated by DALL·E" loading="lazy" width="1792" height="1024"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">An AI generated image for sleazy website.

It gets even worse!</h3><p></p><p>I've been looking for a job, so I've set my status to "Open to Work". </p><p>Last week, LinkedIn decided I was a hiring manager, and asked if I wanted to become a recruiter on their site. And I was like, how can I be hiring people when I'm looking for a job myself. It's so stupid I had to take a screenshot and make a post on LinkedIn:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2024/01/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-12.39.51@2x.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="576" srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2024/01/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-12.39.51@2x.png 600w, ../../content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-12.39.51@2x.png 1000w, ../../content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-12.39.51@2x.png 1600w, ../../content/images/2024/01/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-12.39.51@2x.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p></p><h3 id="other-issues">Other issues</h3><p>I've stopped getting notifications when people reply to my posts or to a comment I posted. Someone posted a thoughtful comment and question to one of my posts, but I never got a notification and so never noticed it. Until this week, when I manually went back and looked at my posts. The person probably thought I was rude or didn't care.</p><p>It doesn't help that to see my own posts I have to click 5-6 times. 🙀</p><p>I didn't change any settings, so it must have been something LinkedIn did.</p><p>So not only can I not see any posts from my network, but if someone is trying to talk to me, they can't! Unless they pay $$ to Linkedin and join the recruiter plan.</p><h3 id="in-summary">In Summary</h3><p></p><p>People have been complaining about LN for years, but at least it was doing the basic jobs I expected from it:</p><ol><li>Keep me connected to people I've worked with</li><li>Connect me with recruiters</li></ol><p>As of now, (1) doesn't work at all, as I can't see any posts from my network because of all the spam. (2) sort of works, but there haven't been any jobs recently. Like 0.00 in the last 2 months.</p><p>The recruiter part of LinkedIn, as I said, still sort of works; but, every job site has a "Share my CV with recruiters" option– why do I need to waste time on LinkedIn?</p><p><strong>There's even a word for this:</strong></p><p>Enshittification, created by Cory Doctrow. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification?ref=new.pythonforengineers.com" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote>According to Doctorow, new platforms offer useful products and services at a loss, as a way to gain new users. Once users are locked in, the platform then offers access to the userbase to suppliers at a loss, and once suppliers are locked-in, the platform shifts surpluses to shareholders. Once the platform is fundamentally focused on the shareholders, and the users and vendors are locked in, the platform no longer has any incentive to maintain quality.</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
