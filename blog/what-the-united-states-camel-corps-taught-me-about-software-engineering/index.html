        <p>Recently, I saw a cool featured article on Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Camel_Corps?ref=new.pythonforengineers.com">The United States Camel Corps</a>. And as I was reading it, I was thinking to myself <em>That's exactly how software engineers think as well!</em></p><p>Let me summarise the article first:</p><ul><li>In the 1850s, the US Army decided to trial the use of camels in the South of America</li><li>At that time, they used horses and mules for transport.</li><li>Camels were brought in because it was believed they would be more sturdy in the tough desert conditions of Texas.</li></ul><p>Did the experiment succeed?</p><ul><li>The camels were sturdier than the mule and horses</li><li>On a few particularly journeys, when several mules died and those that survived were very distressed, the camels were okay</li><li>A camel was bitten by a  rattlesnake and still survived</li><li>Camels didn't need water on the journey, and would eat anything on the way, including a creole bush that no other animal would eat</li></ul><p>So camels were super successful, right?</p><p>Nope. The army abandoned the project and sold all the camels at an auction. One reason was the Civil War started, interrupting the experiment. But I think a bigger reason is: The US Army was a mule and horses organisation, and camels were too different culturally to make the change, even if they were technically better.</p><p>And this leads us nicely to software.</p><p><strong>Ooooh, but X is technically superior, so it will succeed</strong></p><p>Every software debate is full about how X should succeed because it is technically superior.</p><ul><li><strong>Linux is technically superior to Windows!</strong> 1999, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2012.......2021 is finally the year of the Linux desktop!</li></ul><p>People have been making fun of how useless Windows is, how we need to move to Linux for 20-30 years now, and yet, people stick to Windows because it works.</p><p>The tone has slightly improved over the years. I remember in the late 90s, when still a teenager, I made the mistake of asking in an online forum what the big deal about Linux was (as I had been hearing of it, but didn't know much of it). I still remember the insults 30 years later. And not one of those people actually told me why Linux was better. <em>Wave hand in the air: But open source! M$ evilz!!</em></p><p>And then every few years, people would predict how Windows was finally going to die and burn in a fiery hell.</p><p>That said, in 2021 I did finally wipe my Windows laptop and install Linux Mint on it (and had been using a Mac for most tasks anyway). </p><p>But it wasn't the technical superiority of Linux that drew me, but more like Microsoft actively kicking me away. I was just pissed off at Microsoft's constant attempts to spy on me and force me to use a Windows login on my own local laptop, so they can spy on me online as well.</p><p><em>At this point, Windows became the hard to manage camel, and Linux the boring mule, so I switched.</em></p><p>Even in the Linux world, it's all like <em>Bah! You use Ubuntu? Should be using Arch, dontcha know it's the superior choice?</em></p><ul><li><strong>Lisp / Haskell / Rust are superior to Java/C++</strong></li></ul><p>When I started programming, everyone on Hacker News/ Slashdot were on and one about how Lisp was superior, how you became a better programmer just by learning Lisp. As I wrote in a <a href="../favorite-programming-language-sucks/index.html">highly quoted and peer-reviewed technical paper</a>, reading <em>50 shades of grey</em> makes you a better programmer than learning Lisp.</p><p>Then the Lisp crowd moved to Haskell. For a time, everyone was shouting at how we need to learn Haskell because <em>ooh, it's so elegant</em></p><p>And now the same crowd has moved to Rust. <em>Rewrite it in Rust </em>is the new religion of the same people.</p><p>And in spite of all the proselyting, most commercial projects are still written in Java/C++. These are the mules of the programming world– they might not be <em>lah-di-dah </em>perfect, but they work as expected and everyone is used to them.</p><ul><li><strong>Excel vs the World</strong></li></ul><p>Every few years, a startup comes up and says <em>Excel is so 90s! We can do better</em></p><p>Seems they can't. Excel is good enough and just works. I could say the same for Jira, but insulting<em> Jira haters</em> and <em>Rust fanbois</em> in the same blog looks like a very dangerous thing to do, so I'll stop.</p><p>Seeing the pattern? It's not the "technically superior" solutions that win, but the good enough solutions that get the work done.</p><p>The job of the US army was to win wars; how they got their supplies (mules or camels) didn't matter as much.</p><p>The job of software is to solve business problems. If a boring and mathematically inelegant language can solve the problem, that's good enough.</p><p>Because let's be honest: <em>Good enough solutions are, in most cases, good enough.</em></p><p>Hard core programmers love camels, but for the rest of us, mules are preferable. Camels may lead to a 10-20% improvement, but they lead to a lot of headaches managing them. Plus, camels expect you to change your whole setup just to work for them.</p><p>Remember, your goal is to move your cannons from A to B, and if mules work, use mules. Don't get drawn in by the attraction of prima donna Rust coders, sorry I meant camels.</p><p>tldr:</p><blockquote>Mules &gt;&gt; Camels</blockquote>
