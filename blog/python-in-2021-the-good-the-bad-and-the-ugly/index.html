Web app development, specifically the back end part. Test and automation, again mainly backend, plus server applications. One startup I worked at was using Powershell and C to do its automation, and this led to fistfights until I graciously intervened and announced we were going to use Python instead (I may be exaggerating, but you get the idea).</p><p>If you are doing anything on Linux servers, chances are, if the script is more than a few hundred lines, most people will prefer Python over Bash. At one company, reviewers would start moaning over any bash script over 20 lines; and I don't blame them.</p><p>I've seen a comment far too many times: <em>X is a great library, I would try it if there was Python support.</em> Many apps are shooting themselves in the foot by not providing Python support.</p><p>So if you are learning programming in 2021, or trying to pick up a new skill, Python is a great option.</p><h3 id="the-bad-%E2%80%93-where-python-sucks">The Bad – Where Python Sucks</h3><p></p><p><strong>1) Installing Python libraries is hard, and often a hit and miss affair</strong></p><p></p><p>Every time I say this, I get pushback. In a previous version of this article I shared in a private group, the most common comment was: </p><p><em>I've never seen this problem, are you sure you're not just imagining it?</em></p><p>And people on Reddit/HN get downright rude <em>LOL, you can't even install Python,  you must be stupid </em>or some version thereof. One person told me, with 100% seriousness, that all my problems would go away if <em>I just learned how to use a virtualenv</em>.  And I was like, thanks a-hole, I never thought of that.</p><p>For a brief period, I thought maybe I <u><em>was stupid</em></u>. After all, all these intelligent people couldn't be wrong, right?</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Just a few minutes of searching showed me quite a few examples of other people suffering from the same problem:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/09/image.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1618" height="214" srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image.png 600w, ../../content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image.png 1000w, ../../content/images/size/w1600/2021/09/image.png 1600w, ../../content/images/2021/09/image.png 1618w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/09/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1483" height="78" srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-3.png 600w, ../../content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-3.png 1000w, ../../content/images/2021/09/image-3.png 1483w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/09/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1564" height="58" srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-1.png 600w, ../../content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-1.png 1000w, ../../content/images/2021/09/image-1.png 1564w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/09/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1582" height="82" srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2021/09/image-2.png 600w, ../../content/images/size/w1000/2021/09/image-2.png 1000w, ../../content/images/2021/09/image-2.png 1582w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So why does this problem exist?</p><p>I find that if you stick to very standard web dev libraries, like Flask/Django, mostly pure Python code, everything works fine. And that's why people can say, with all seriousness, that Python is easy to install.</p><p>The problem arises in 3 situations:</p><ol><li>Data science, Video/Image processing, gaming, or other libraries that have a lot of C/C++ code</li><li>Trying to give Python code to a non-programmer, or even a non-Python programmer</li><li>People like me who like to try out a lot of new libraries, just to learn new stuff</li></ol><p></p><p>Just in the last 2 weeks, I had code that was working suddenly stop working when I updated a library (which I had to use a newer feature; also see the backwards compatibility section below).</p><p>I was trying a new gaming library– and it just wouldn't install on Windows, but worked fine on Linux. Windows is still a 2nd class citizen in the Python world.</p><p>And to make it worse– I got different errors when I tried using <em>pip install </em>vs <em>conda install. </em>And different errors on different Python versions– we are talking about small version differences like <em>3.7 vs 3.8</em></p><p></p><p>I can't remember how many cool libraries/projects I've had to abandon as I couldn't even get the libraries installed. </p><p>And it becomes a nightmare if you want to share your code with people new to Python. When I was writing my <a href="../../books.html">books</a>, I found it easier to ship a 5GB virtual machine with everything installed, rather than try to help people install Python (and lots of other authors were doing the same thing, at one point I had a folder with 60-80GB of virtual machines,<em> just for Python</em>).</p><p>Pythonistas make fun of Javascript and NodeJs platform, but Python is as messy, if not messier, than Node.</p><h3 id="there-is-only-one-and-200-ways-to-do-it">There is only one and 200 ways to do it</h3><p>The Zen of Python, which people have stopped quoting (I wonder why), says:</p><blockquote>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</blockquote><p>Yeah, sure, pal. Maybe in 2002.</p><p>In 2021:</p><ul><li>Want to create isolated environments? Great! You have virtualenv, virtualenv wrapper, pipenv, poetry, conda. And somewhat related, though slightly different use case: pyenv and pipx</li><li>Install Python or libraries? You can do pip install, apt install, brew install, and all will mess up your system in different ways</li><li>Random libraries will come in and mess up your system Python</li></ul><p>Now, the Python elite will look down from their nose and say <em>Ah, ole chap, but you are supposed to use blah blah blah to make your work easier.</em></p><p>But beginners don't know all that (and seriously, should they be forced to learn if they just want to try out a script?)</p><p>Programmers with 10+ years of experience(but new to Python) struggle with this.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p><strong>Code written today may break tomorrow– Backward Compatibility is a Joke</strong></p><p>A Java programmer once insulted me(well, he was complaining generally, but looking in my direction, so I took it personally):</p><blockquote>I have this code written in Java7 (which was 9 years old at the time), and it still works today. With Python, last week's code wont work today</blockquote><p>I was ready to challenge him to a duel; took off my gloves and my flintlock pistols and everything; when I paused. The dude had a point.</p><p>This problem is mainly with libraries, but there is a <em>move fast and break </em>things that is very irritating. Libraries are re-written/refactored for no reason I can see.</p><p>Yeah, I get it. Sometimes, you have to refactor code. The code is maintained by unpaid volunteers etc etc. But I wish the community was more strict about backwards compatibility. All the "grown-up" languages are.</p><p></p><h2 id="summary-tldr-and-where-i-try-to-make-up">Summary, tldr, and where I try to make up</h2><p>I realise this post comes across as very negative to Python. But I still love and use Python daily, and hope it improves and gets better. So much so that anytime a Rust programmer even thinks about opening their mouth, a dozen Python programmers jump in and say <em>Actually, you should rewrite it in Python</em>.</p><p>The tldr is:</p><ul><li>Python awesome to find a job</li><li>Python is fun to program in, and super productive</li><li>Problems are installing libraries and actually distributing your code so others can use it</li></ul>
