Scenes in Godot include levels, players, enemies etc; anything you can code or design and the player interacts with.</p><p>The green part below that is the local filesystem, and any files you need for your game, like graphics or sound, can be seen here.</p><p>The big blue part in the middle is where the main game screen is. Here you will see the levels you design visually, or the code you write.</p><p>To move between the graphics and code, the purple box above the blue tells you how. Clicking on 2D (or 3D) will take you to the graphical part. While clicking on the script will take you to the code.</p><p>The yellow box on the top right allows you to play the game.</p><p>The grey box below that is where you can see details of whatever item you chose. For example, if you create a player scene, you can choose the sprite here. For music nodes, you can select which file you want to play, etc.</p><h3 id="starting-the-game">Starting the Game</h3><p>On the left, choose 2d scene and  rename the scene to level 1 (by double clicking on it):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/11/p2.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="739" height="630"></figure><p>Save the scene as Level1.tscn</p><p>Click the + at the top to add a new scene:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/10/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="913" height="409" srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2021/10/image-3.png 600w, ../../content/images/2021/10/image-3.png 913w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In Godot, a scene is not just the levels but can be things like characters, hazards etc. The advantage of having them as a scene is that you can mix the characters with different levels, for example, without having to create a new character each time.</p><p>Now, in the scene window, click plus to add a node:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/10/image-5.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="301" height="370"></figure><p>In the window that comes up, start typing "kine", and you will see the below:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/11/p3.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1803" height="915"></figure><p>Make sure you choose KinematicBody2D, the blue one, as we are making a 2d game, and rename it to player.</p><p>Save the file as player.tscn</p><h3 id="adding-the-sprite">Adding the Sprite</h3><p></p><p>The next thing to do is to add a sprite to our player.

So we need to define a shape– the shape will make sure Godot can check if the player collides with other objects. Let's add a shape now.</p><p>Make sure you have the player selected (and not Sprite), click add and add the CollisionShape2d node:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/11/p6.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1613" height="872"></figure><p>There is still a warning--the Collision  Shape doesn't have a "shape" :)</p><p>Let's add a rectangle shape– its the simplest and work for us, as our character is roughly a rectangle:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/11/p7.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1913" height="447"></figure><p>The next thing to do is zoom into our player, and make sure the whole CollisionShape covers it:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/11/p8.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="893" height="552"></figure><p>What this means is: Godot now knows what the shape of our player is, and can track if it is colliding with the enemy, platforms etc.</p><p>There are different shape types, and you can even click and select for complex shapes, but we won't go into that now.</p><p>Now we need to add our player to the scene. Click on level1, and make sure you click the link button, not the add new node button:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2021/11/p9.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="987" height="589"></figure><p>That's it.

	elif Input.is_action_pressed("left"):
		velocity.x = -SPEED
	else:
		velocity.x = 0</code></pre><p>If the user presses right, increase the x part of velocity by SPEED, which we described before. Same for the left.</p><p>GdScript, the language, is very similar to Python, so if you know Python you can follow it easily.</p><p>If the user isn't pressing anything, set the x velocity to 0.</p><p>That's good, but though we are changing the velocity, we are not applying this to the player. For that, we will use the<em> move_and_slide()</em> function (<a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/using_kinematic_body_2d.html?ref=new.pythonforengineers.com">https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/using_kinematic_body_2d.html</a>)</p><p>From the docs:</p><blockquote>When moving a <code>KinematicBody2D</code>, you should not set its <code>position</code> property directly. Instead, you use the <code>move_and_collide()</code> or <code>move_and_slide()</code> methods. These methods move the body along a given vector and instantly stop if a collision is detected with another body. After a KinematicBody2D has collided, any <em>collision response</em> must be coded manually.</blockquote><blockquote>The <code>move_and_slide()</code> method is intended to simplify the collision response in the common case where you want one body to slide along the other. It is especially useful in platformers or top-down games, for example.</blockquote><p>So let's use this method:</p><pre><code>velocity = move_and_slide(velocity)	</code></pre><p>We update the player body with our velocity variable and return the variable for future use. </p><p>The whole function is:</p><pre><code class="language-python">func _physics_process(_delta):
	if Input.is_action_pressed("right"):
		velocity.x = SPEED
	elif Input.is_action_pressed("left"):
		velocity.x = -SPEED
