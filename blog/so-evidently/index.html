Tried GPT4 first, it gave me the standard "log analyser" that all blogs I've seen build, and I wanted to try something different. So I asked Gemini Pro from Google.</p><p>It gave me a few tips, but there was one thing I didn't understand: It said <em>"Adding caching to functions"</em>. Though I knew what caching is, I'd never heard anyone do it to Python functions.</p><p>So I asked it to clarify what it was saying, and got this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2024/02/gemini-dont-like-caching.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1680" height="874" srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2024/02/gemini-dont-like-caching.png 600w, ../../content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/gemini-dont-like-caching.png 1000w, ../../content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/gemini-dont-like-caching.png 1600w, ../../content/images/2024/02/gemini-dont-like-caching.png 1680w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Gemini replied:<em> "My response to your message was blocked for potentially violating safety policies. I apologize for any inconvenience."</em></p><p>Ummm, what?</p><p>Luckily, there was an option there to ask why:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-23-at-22.08.54@2x.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1586" height="1022" srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-23-at-22.08.54@2x.png 600w, ../../content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-23-at-22.08.54@2x.png 1000w, ../../content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-23-at-22.08.54@2x.png 1586w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>What it is saying is: Caching can lead to stale data. This is true of general caching, not just caching functions in Python. And the reply is, so what?</p><p>But if you look at the last point, it says:</p><p><em><strong>Legal and Compliance:</strong> Caching certain types of data may violate legal or compliance requirements, such as those related to data privacy or intellectual property.</em></p><p>Yeah, on websites that store sensitive data, that might be the case but I find it hard to see how or why. Almost all websites use caching in one form or another.</p><p>Besides, that is beyond the point. I had just asked about projects using generators in Python. Gemini suggested caching. But then it decided I could be breaking the law <strong>just by writing code that runs on my laptop </strong>and censored itself.</p><p>I was so depressed I decided to pray to god (or goddess in my case).</p><h3 id="the-goddess-of-wisdom-is-defeated"><strong>The Goddess of Wisdom is DEFEATED</strong></h3><p></p><p>Someone asked me "What is <em>mantra</em> for <em>Saraswati</em>?", which if you don't know is the Hindu Goddess of Wisdom and Knowledge. (A <em>mantra</em> is like a prayer).</p><p> I was like, how should I know? I'll search for it.</p><p><em>(Side note: Why don't I know? In my defence, Hinduism does have 33 million gods, it gets a bit tiring after the 1st 12 million. Besides everyone in India worships the Goddess of Wealth, poor Saraswati sits there in the corner all alone).</em></p><p>I have been disillusioned with Google, as it keeps returning spam results. (And it did, the first result was for a website that wanted to know my location so they could sell me prayer mats).</p><p>So I asked ChatGPT. I asked for the mantra in Sanskrit, as that gives me correct pronunciation. It gave me the mantra, all was good.</p><p>But after my experience with Python, I decided to try Gemini. It gave me the mantra in English.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.52.20@2x.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1628" height="694" srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.52.20@2x.png 600w, ../../content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.52.20@2x.png 1000w, ../../content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.52.20@2x.png 1600w, ../../content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.52.20@2x.png 1628w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>But when I asked it to give me in Sanskrit, it gave me the "Message was blocked for violating safety policies" shtick</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../../content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.53.49@2x.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1622" height="386" srcset="../../content/images/size/w600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.53.49@2x.png 600w, ../../content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.53.49@2x.png 1000w, ../../content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.53.49@2x.png 1600w, ../../content/images/2024/02/CleanShot-2024-02-25-at-19.53.49@2x.png 1622w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>That was weird.

                <p>Online forums, especially Hacker News and Reddit, are very hostile to LinkedIn. Everyone makes fun of the self-promotion and silliness that goes there. There are complaints the site is unusable, which I didn&#39;t agree with until now.

I&#39;ve had an account there for a few years.</p>
